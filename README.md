## 🚀 Pipeline Overview (Thoughtfully Designed)

| Step | Component                        | Purpose                                                                 |
|------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1️⃣   | `fetch_data.py`                | Use PRAW to scrape long-form posts from selected AI-related subreddits |
| 2️⃣   | `clean_data.py`                | Clean, normalize, remove noise, and prepare text for modeling          |
| 3️⃣   | `encode_text.py`               | Generate sentence-level embeddings using `MiniLM` transformer          |
| 4️⃣   | `extract_keywords.py`          | Extract top keywords per post using KeyBERT (cosine similarity method) |
| 5️⃣   | `cluster_kmeans.py`            | Apply KMeans, compute Silhouette Score, visualize elbow & clusters     |
| 6️⃣   | `cluster_hdbscan.py`           | Use HDBSCAN for density-based clustering with noise/outlier detection  |
| 7️⃣   | `add_pca_coordinates.py`       | Run PCA to reduce embeddings to 2D for scatter plots                   |
| 8️⃣   | `app.py`                       | Streamlit dashboard for filtering, keyword browsing, topic exploration |
| 9️⃣   | `email_dispatcher.py`          | Send summaries of cluster results by email (via SMTP)                  |
| 🔬    | `clustering_analysis_.ipynb`   | Extra insights: cluster quality, keyword coherence, comparisons        |

## 🧠 Scientific Choices & Rationale

- **Sentence Embeddings (MiniLM)**: Balanced between speed and semantic richness, MiniLM lets us represent posts in vector space for clustering.
- **Keyword Extraction (KeyBERT)**: Uses transformer similarity to pull contextually relevant terms (not just frequent words).
- **KMeans**: Good for structured, quick clustering; we tune `k` with elbow and silhouette score.
- **HDBSCAN**: Excels at detecting noise and irregular cluster shapes — more realistic for Reddit's messy, organic data.
- **PCA**: Helps reduce high-dimensional embeddings to 2D while preserving structure for scatter plot visualization.
- **Streamlit**: Chosen for interactive UX, easy exploration, and fast deployment.
- **Email Summary**: Automates stakeholder updates with a summary of what's trending.

## ⚙️ How to Run Everything (FULL PIPELINE)

### 1. 🔧 Install dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your/reddit-topic-explorer.git
cd reddit-topic-explorer
cp .env.example .env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. 🔁 Run full pipeline step-by-step
```bash
python fetch_data.py           # Pull Reddit posts (PRAW)
python clean_data.py           # Clean & normalize
python encode_text.py          # Embed with MiniLM
python extract_keywords.py     # Keyword extraction (KeyBERT)
python cluster_kmeans.py       # KMeans clustering + visuals
python cluster_hdbscan.py      # HDBSCAN clustering + visuals
python extract_keywords.py     # Keyword extraction (KeyBERT)
python add_pca_coordinates.py  # For dashboard visual scatter
```

### 3. 🧪 Explore clusters in the notebook
Open `clustering_analysis_.ipynb` for:
- Cluster samples
- Keyword coherence checks
- Dimensionality sanity checks

### 4. 📊 Launch Streamlit dashboard
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Use the dashboard to:
- Filter posts by cluster or keywords
- Explore PCA scatter
- Dive into each cluster’s topic

### 5. 📬 Send summary by email (optional)
```bash
python email_dispatcher.py
```

Your `.env` must include SMTP credentials:
```
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret
REDDIT_USERNAME=your_username
REDDIT_PASSWORD=your_password
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=reddit-topic-explorer

EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your@email.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_password
EMAIL_TO=recipient@email.com
```
